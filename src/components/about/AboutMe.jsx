            I am an enthusiastic front-end developer looking for exciting opportunities. Likes to focus on accessibility and recently started putting into consideration carbon emission when developing. Therefore I also like to consider the impact of carbon footprint in development. Passionate and curious about solving problems. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs, Webflow and a bit of Designing. While I am not programming, I enjoy playing jogging and playing with my family. Learning more to improve skill.
